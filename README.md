AI Coffee Assistant
The AI Coffee Assistant is a web application designed to help coffee enthusiasts overcome the frustrating process of "dialing in" a new bag of coffee. By leveraging Google's Gemini AI with web-browsing capabilities, this tool provides a data-driven, actionable starting point for your grinder setting, helping you waste less coffee and get to a delicious cup faster.

The Problem: The "Dial-In" Dilemma
Every coffee lover knows the feeling: you buy an exciting new bag of beans, but the first few cups are a disappointment. You're stuck in the frustrating, wasteful, and time-consuming process of dialing in your grinder.

You search online, and the advice is scattered and often contradictory. One forum says "22 clicks" and a YouTube video uses a completely different grinder. You're left guessing, wasting expensive beans, and wondering if you'll ever taste the flavors promised on the bag.

This project was born out of that exact frustration. I wanted to create a tool that could cut through the noise and provide a single, intelligent, and well-researched starting point, tailored to your specific setup.

The Solution: Your AI-Powered Barista
This application acts as an expert coffee consultant. Instead of just giving a generic answer, it uses a powerful AI model to perform a targeted web search for your specific grinder, beans, and brew method. It then synthesizes the information from top search results—including guides, reviews, and forum discussions—to provide a recommendation.

The result is not just a number, but a complete recommendation that includes:

A recommended setting and its unit (e.g., clicks, numbers).

A confidence level based on the quality of information found.

A summary explaining the reasoning behind the recommendation.
